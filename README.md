### Necessary programs:
    - EWW (of course)
    - playerctl to see and control music
    - Jetbrains Mono Nerdfont to get some glyphs and icons, though I am moving to using just images
    - Pipewire with WirePlumber to control volume

## The launch script included currently only works on Arch Linux 
I will look into fixing it for more distros in the future, however, you can still launch all necessary windows from CLI with the command found in the script `eww open-many ...`
